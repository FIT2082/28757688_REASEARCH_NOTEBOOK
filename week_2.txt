<h3>About scikit_image</h3>
<p>
Skimage is an image manipulation open source library programmed by hundreds of people all over the globe. It is used for research to help scientists analyse their results.

<h3>Our contribution</h3>
<p>
For this project, Sean and I will be contributing to it by programming an f-line image transformation session. If time will permit, we will also take another mini-project (yet to be chosen) such as adding a horizontal vertical transform.
</p>

<h4>f-line transformation</h4>
<p>
Ideally, near the end of the project, the library will perform the ideal transformation on an image to turn it into a similar image used in the same study. This will allow to better quantify before and after effects in a group of images. When looking at the after images, they will all be transformed to a standard determained at the start.
