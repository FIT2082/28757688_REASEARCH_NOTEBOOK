# About scikit_image

Skimage is an image manipulation open source library programmed by hundreds of people all over the globe. It is used for research to help scientists analyse their results.

# Our contribution

For this project, Sean and I will be contributing to it by programming an f-line image transformation session. If time will permit, we will also take another mini-project (yet to be chosen) such as adding a horizontal vertical transform.

# f-line transformation

Ideally, near the end of the project, the library will perform the ideal transformation on an image to turn it into a similar image used in the same study. This will allow to better quantify before and after effects in a group of images. When looking at the after images, they will all be transformed to a standard determained at the start.
