## Pre-team-meeting
Gone over a few tutorials for skimage and related libraries. The library can do quite a bit - by the end of this project I will still be scratching the surface in terms of what it can do.

## Team-meeting
Talked about what we have done the past week, about timelines for the project and the project specification.

## To-do
Add Gala code to skimage. Read chapter 7 of the skimage book. Project specs.
